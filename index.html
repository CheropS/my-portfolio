                <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>Do you want to know a little about me?</p>
                        <h3>Education Background</h3>
                            <p>I have a background of education in mathematics. I did my undergraduate degree at the Univeristy of Nairobi, Bachelor of Science in Mathematics.</p>
                            <p>I later on did a professional paper in Certified Investment and Financial Analysis.</p>
                            <p>While learning more about finances, I stumbled upon a course that required an integration of financial modelling and Python language.</p>
                            <p>Instinctively, I started learning it but I could not grasp the whole knowledge of it since my background in programming was as little as negligible. For this reason, I opted to learn more about programming and lead me to become a developer.</p>
                        <h3>Job Experience</h3>
                            <p>I have worked mostly in organizations as a financial advisor or an accountant.</p>
                            <p>I also have an experience in data analysis having worked for International Budget Partnership, Nairobi.</p>
